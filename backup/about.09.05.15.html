     <p class="credo">The term refers to SB 435, an Illinois law passed in July 2008 to protect consumers from fraudulent Tow Operators. These unscrupulous operators would capitalize on the misfortune of stranded motorists and often charged exorbitant fees.
     <br />
        Essentially, the law requires the Illinois Commerce Commission to license Safety Relocators (the legal term for Tow Companies). Customers must now authorize a tow before it occurs, and where the vehicle is destined to be relocated. There must also be an accounting of the actual cost for towing, storage, and other fees. This includes the right to an itemized invoice and the right to pay in cash or with credit card.
     <br />
       Tow-truck operators must also have company name, address, and phone number displayed on the truck, with invoice records kept back as far as five years, to be provided upon request.
     <br />
